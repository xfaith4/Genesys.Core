# Endpoint Combinations — Investigation Patterns & Executive Rollups

> Status: Active  
> Last updated: 2026-08-28  
> Companion to: [INVESTIGATIONS.md](INVESTIGATIONS.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

This document describes how catalog datasets combine into coherent investigations and executive
reporting rollups. Each combination is documented with its subject, the ordered dataset steps,
the join keys that connect them, and the analytical questions it answers.

The goal of Genesys.Core is to be **informative without being a data dump**. Every combination
here answers a specific operational question and terminates when that question is answered — not
when the API is exhausted.

**Machine-readable counterpart:** every pattern below (except the metric glossary) is also encoded
as a structured recipe in `catalog/genesys.catalog.json` under `combinations.investigationRecipes`,
`combinations.executiveReportingPlaybooks`, and `combinations.voiceEngineerPlaybooks`. The JSON
recipes carry the same step/joinKey/dataset shape as this document plus `executiveMetrics` and
`voiceEngineerHighlights` arrays intended for direct consumption by reporting/investigation
tooling. Pattern 5 (Real-Time Operations Monitoring) maps to the
`real-time-operations-monitoring` recipe key; Pattern 6 (BYOI Enrichment) maps to the
`byoi-conversation-enrichment` recipe key. Every `dataset` value in a JSON recipe resolves to
either a curated `datasets` entry or a raw `endpoints` operationId in the same catalog file —
there is no third namespace.

**2026-08-28 additions:** the `byoi-conversation-enrichment` recipe gained an `external-contact` step
(`externalcontacts.get.contact`) resolving `externalContactId` to a CRM identity — see Pattern 6. The
`flow-and-ivr-performance` executive playbook and `flow-and-ivr-diagnostics` voice engineer playbook
gained bot-flow turn-level detail and knowledge-base deflection aggregates — see Pattern 10.

## 1. Single Conversation Deep Dive (Voice Engineer)

**Subject:** One `conversationId`  
**Use case:** A voice engineer or QM analyst receives a complaint about a specific call — wrong queue, long hold, audio quality, dropped call, incorrect routing. They need the complete picture of one conversation: where it came from, how it routed, how long each phase took, what the SIP signaling said, whether a recording exists, and what the quality score was.

**Core question:** *What actually happened in this conversation, end-to-end?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `conversations.get.conversation.object` | seed → `conversationId` | Participants, sessions, DNIS/ANI, start/end times, queue assignment, externalTag (BYOI indicator) |
| 2 | `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` | `conversationId` | Per-segment timing: IVR duration, ACD wait, talk time, hold time, ACW, conference, recording start/stop |
| 3 | `conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata` | `conversationId` | Recording IDs, media type, duration, deletion schedule |
| 4 | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | `conversationId` | Custom attributes set by IVR/Architect flows (account numbers, intent, escalation flags) |
| 5 | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | `conversationId` | Participant-level attributes (IVR variables, data action outcomes, flow-set values) |
| 6 | `quality.get.evaluations.query` | `conversationId` | QM evaluation scores, form used, evaluator, calibration status |
| 7 | `quality.get.surveys` | `conversationId` | Post-call CSAT/NPS survey result if survey was triggered |
| 8 *(voice only)* | `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | SIP signaling trace: INVITE, 200 OK, BYE, re-INVITE, codec negotiation |
| 9 *(STA enabled)* | `conversations.get.speech.text.analytics` | `conversationId` | Sentiment score, detected topics, STA coverage summary |
| 10 *(STA enabled)* | `speech.and.text.analytics.get.sentiment.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | Sentiment timeline: per-utterance scores, agent vs customer breakdown |
| 11 *(transcription enabled)* | `speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl` | `conversationId` + `communicationId` | Transcript download URL per communication leg |

### Key Joins

```
conversations.get.conversation.object.conversationId
  → analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics.conversationId (segment overlay)
  → conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata.conversationId
  → telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation.conversationId (voice only)
  → quality.get.evaluations.query[].conversationId (left join — evaluations may not exist)

analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics.participants[].sessions[].communicationId
  → speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl.communicationId
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- What was the full call flow? (IVR → ACD → agent → hold → ACW)
- How long did the customer wait before an agent answered?
- Was the call transferred? How many times? What queue received the transfer?
- Was a recording made? Does it still exist?
- Did the SIP trunk establish media correctly? (from SIP trace)
- Was the agent rated? What was the QM score?
- Was the customer surveyed? What was the CSAT result?
- What intent/attributes did the IVR capture before routing?

### Voice Engineer Notes

Step 8 (SIP trace) is the definitive source for:
- Call setup failures (no 200 OK, 486 Busy, 503 Service Unavailable)
- One-way audio (media IP mismatch in SDP)
- Premature disconnection (BYE before expected, no 200 OK to BYE)
- Codec negotiation failures

The `telephony.get.edge.performance.metrics` dataset (`GET /api/v2/telephony/providers/edges/{edgeId}/metrics`)
should be pulled for the Edge appliance that handled the call if CPU, memory, or error counters suggest
resource pressure during the conversation window.

### BYOI Indicator

If `conversations.get.conversation.object` returns a non-null `externalTag` or `externalConversationId`,
the call was injected via the BYOI integration (`POST /api/v2/conversations/providers/{providerId}/calls`).
Custom attributes in step 4 will contain the provider's context (CRM case ID, external call ID).
The SIP trace (step 8) will reflect the provider's SIP-to-SIP handoff, not an inbound PSTN leg.

---

## 2. All Conversations in a Queue

**Subject:** One `queueId` + time window  
**Use case:** A contact centre supervisor or operations analyst needs to understand the health and
behaviour of a specific queue over a period — volume patterns, handle times, abandons, transfer
rates, and wrapup outcomes.

**Core question:** *How did this queue perform, and what were the conversations like?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `routing.get.single.queue.config` | seed → `queueId` | Queue name, routing method, SLA targets, media types, skill evaluation mode |
| 2 | `routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue` | `queueId` | Human-readable wrapup code labels for the queue |
| 3 | `analytics-conversation-details-query` (queueId filter) | `queueId` | Every conversation that touched this queue in the window, with participant/segment detail |
| 4 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance` | `queueId` | Aggregate: nConnected, tHandle, tTalk, tAcw, tAnswered, tHeld, nOffered, nOutbound |
| 5 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` | `queueId` | Abandon count: nAbandoned, tAbandon, tShortAbandon |
| 6 | `analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level` | `queueId` | SLA achievement: nAnsweredIn20/30/60, oServiceLevel, oServiceTarget, nOverSla |
| 7 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId` | Transfer analysis: nTransferred, nBlindTransferred, nConsultTransferred |
| 8 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId` + wrapUpCode | Wrapup code frequencies (join step 2 for labels) |
| 9 | `routing-queue-members` | `queueId` | Current membership roster with routing status and presence |
| 10 | `quality.get.evaluations.query` (queueId filter) | `conversationId` | QM evaluation coverage and scores for conversations in this queue |

### Key Joins

```
routing.get.single.queue.config.id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.*.queueId (aggregate overlay)
  → routing-queue-members.queueId (who was staffed)

analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution.wrapUpCode
  → routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue.id (label resolution)

analytics-conversation-details-query[].conversationId
  → quality.get.evaluations.query[].conversationId (left join — not all conversations are evaluated)
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- What was the offered/connected/abandoned volume for this queue?
- Did the queue meet its SLA target? In which hourly intervals did it miss?
- What percentage of conversations were transferred? Where did they go?
- What wrapup codes dominated, and what do they mean?
- Who were the active agents? What was their routing status during the window?
- How many conversations were quality-reviewed? What was the average score?

### Divisions as Queue Groups

Queues within a division represent a natural management boundary — a division is effectively
a group of queues and agents. To investigate an entire division:
1. Use `authorization.list.division.queues` to get all queue IDs in the division.
2. Fan out the steps above once per queue, or use `authorization.get.single.division` as the
   seed and filter analytics queries with `divisionId` predicates.

---

## 3. Division / Agent Group Investigation

**Subject:** One `divisionId` + time window  
**Use case:** A contact centre director or workforce analyst needs to understand how a specific
business unit (division) performed — which agents are in it, what volume each handled, time-in-state,
quality scores, and coaching coverage.

**Core question:** *How did this division's agents perform as a group?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `authorization.get.single.division` | seed → `divisionId` | Division name, description, home-division flag |
| 2 | `authorization.list.division.queues` | `divisionId` | All queue IDs assigned to this division |
| 3 | `users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info` | `divisionId` | All agents assigned to the division with user IDs |
| 4 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance` (divisionId filter) | `userId` | Per-agent: nConnected, tHandle, tTalk, tAcw, tAnswered |
| 5 | `analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity` (divisionId filter) | `userId` | Per-agent time-in-state: tAgentRoutingStatus, tSystemPresence, tOrganizationPresence |
| 6 | `analytics.query.user.details.activity.report` (userId list) | `userId` | Login/logout/on-queue presence event timeline per agent |
| 7 | `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | QM evaluation counts, highest/average/lowest scores per agent |
| 8 | `coaching.get.appointments` | `userId` | Coaching sessions scheduled/completed for agents in the window |
| 9 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` (divisionId filter) | `queueId` | Wrapup code distribution across all queues in the division |

### Key Joins

```
authorization.get.single.division.id
  → authorization.list.division.queues.divisionId (queue enumeration)
  → users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info.divisionId (agent enumeration)

users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info[].id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance[].userId
  → analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity[].userId
  → quality.get.agents.activity[].user.id
  → coaching.get.appointments[].attendees[].id
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- How many agents are in this division and who are they?
- What queues does this division own?
- Which agents handled the most volume? Which had the highest AHT?
- Which agents spent the most time off-queue or in non-productive states?
- Which agents have been evaluated? Who has the highest/lowest scores?
- Which agents have received recent coaching? Is coaching correlated with score improvement?

### Division vs Queue as Investigation Entry Point

| Start with | When you know | You get |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `queueId` | Specific queue complaints | All conversations + SLA + wrapup + member roster |
| `divisionId` | Business unit or team scope | All queues + all agents + group performance |
| `userId` (Agent Investigation) | Specific agent complaint | That agent's conversations + skills + presence |

---

## 4. Executive Reporting Rollup

**Subject:** Organisation-wide (or multi-queue) + reporting window (weekly/monthly)  
**Use case:** A VP or Director of Operations needs a concise performance summary suitable for
executive review — not a data dump, but the headline KPIs grouped logically.

**Core question:** *How did the contact centre perform this period, by which dimensions?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered by reporting layer)

#### Layer 1 — Volume & Efficiency
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance` | `queueId`, `mediaType`, daily granularity | nOffered, nConnected, tHandle (avg), tTalk (avg), tAcw (avg) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` | `queueId`, `mediaType`, daily | nAbandoned, tAbandon, nOffered (abandon rate = nAbandoned/nOffered) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.digital.channels` | `mediaType`, `queueId`, daily | Channel mix: nOffered, nConnected by voice/chat/email/message |

#### Layer 2 — Service Quality
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level` | `queueId`, daily | oServiceLevel, nOverSla, nAnsweredIn20 (configurable speed-of-answer) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId`, daily | Transfer rate: nTransferred / nConnected |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId`, `wrapUpCode`, daily | Wrapup mix — outcome analysis |

#### Layer 3 — Workforce
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity` | `userId`, daily | tAgentRoutingStatus: available, busy, on-queue time per agent |
| `analytics.query.user.aggregates.performance.metrics` | `userId`, daily | nConnected, tHandle (avg) per agent — productivity comparison |

#### Layer 4 — Quality & Voice-of-Customer
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | Evaluation coverage rate, average score, score distribution |
| `quality.get.surveys` | `conversationId` (aggregate) | CSAT/NPS: response rate, average score |
| `analytics.post.transcripts.aggregates.query` | `queueId`, `userId`, daily | Speech analytics coverage: nSpeechTextAnalyzedConversations, oSentimentScore |

#### Layer 5 — Infrastructure Health (optional, voice-focused)
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `telephony.get.trunk.metrics.summary` | — | SIP trunk utilisation, errors |
| `telephony.get.edges` | `edgeId` | Edge registration status |
| `alerting.get.alerts` | — | Currently firing threshold alerts |

### Executive Dashboard Composition Pattern

```
Period: Last 28 days, daily granularity
Queues: All production queues (from routing-queues, filtered by active=true)

Headline metrics (computed, not raw):
  - Total handled: SUM(nConnected) across all queues
  - Abandon rate: SUM(nAbandoned) / SUM(nOffered) × 100
  - Average handle time: WAVG(tHandle, nConnected)
  - SLA achievement: queues meeting target / total queues × 100
  - Transfer rate: SUM(nTransferred) / SUM(nConnected) × 100
  - QM coverage: evaluations / nConnected × 100
  - Average QM score: from quality.get.agents.activity
  - Avg CSAT: from quality.get.surveys

Trend views (daily granularity):
  - Volume by day with channel mix
  - AHT trend by queue
  - Abandon rate trend by queue
  - SLA achievement heatmap by queue × day
```

### Key Joins for Executive Reporting

```
routing-queues[].id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.*.results[].group.queueId
  → routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue.queueId (label resolution)
  → quality.get.agents.activity (left join via queue membership)

analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution[].group.wrapUpCode
  → routing.get.all.wrapup.codes[].id (global wrapup code labels)
```

---

## 5. Real-Time Operations Monitoring

**Subject:** Organisation or specific queues (no fixed window — point-in-time)  
**Use case:** A real-time analyst, supervisor, or NOC team needs a live view of queue health and
agent availability right now, without waiting for a historical analytics job.

**Core question:** *What is happening in the contact centre this moment?*

### Dataset Steps (real-time, polling pattern)

| Step | Dataset Key | Scope | What It Shows |
|------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | `analytics.query.queue.observations.real.time.stats` | All queues | oInteracting, oWaiting, oOnQueueUsers, oOffQueueUsers, oActiveUsers per queue |
| 2 | `analytics.query.conversation.activity.real.time` | All queues | oInteracting, oWaiting, oAlerting, oLongestWaiting per queue × mediaType |
| 3 | `analytics.query.user.observations.real.time.status` | All agents | oUserPresence (system presence), oUserRoutingStatus per agent |
| 4 | `analytics.get.agent.active.status` | One agent | Full real-time channel assignment for a specific agent — active conversation IDs |
| 5 | `users.get.agent.active.conversations` | One agent | All in-progress conversations for a specific agent |
| 6 | `users.get.agent.current.routing.status` | One agent | Current routing state (IDLE / INTERACTING / NOT_RESPONDING / OFF_QUEUE) |
| 7 | `analytics.query.flow.observations` | All flows | oFlow: active Architect flows currently executing |
| 8 *(telephony NOC)* | `telephony.get.trunk.metrics.summary` | — | Trunk utilisation and error counters |
| 9 *(telephony NOC)* | `telephony.get.edge.performance.metrics` | One Edge | CPU, memory, active call count on specific Edge |

### Polling Note

Real-time datasets (`analytics.query.queue.observations.real.time.stats`,
`analytics.query.conversation.activity.real.time`, `analytics.query.user.observations.real.time.status`)
do not accept `interval` parameters — they reflect the current state as of the API call. These
should be polled at the rate appropriate for the display (typically 10–30 seconds for a wall board).

The `analytics.get.agent.active.status` endpoint returns a single agent's live state and is
intended for targeted drilldown (supervisor clicks on an agent in the wall board).

---

## 6. BYOI External Conversation Enrichment

**Subject:** One `conversationId` that was injected via BYOI  
**Use case:** A conversation originated in an external system (CRM telephony, third-party contact
centre, a custom SIP provider) and was injected into Genesys Cloud via the BYOI provider API
(`POST /api/v2/conversations/providers/{providerId}/calls`). The conversation appears in Genesys
analytics and recordings, but context lives in the external system.

**Core question:** *Where did this conversation come from, and what external context does it carry?*

### How to Identify a BYOI Conversation

In step 1 of the Conversation Investigation, `conversations.get.conversation.object` returns:

```json
{
  "externalTag": "<your-provider-set-tag>",
  "externalConversationId": "<provider-conversation-id>",
  "participants": [
    { "purpose": "external", "externalContactId": "..." }
  ]
}
```

A non-null `externalTag` is the definitive BYOI indicator.

### Additional Steps for BYOI Conversations

| Step | Dataset Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| + | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | Provider-set custom attributes: CRM case ID, intent label, external call ID |
| + | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | IVR/Architect variables set during the injected conversation flow |
| + | `externalcontacts.get.contact` (`GET /api/v2/externalcontacts/contacts/{contactId}`) | Resolves `participants[].externalContactId` to the actual CRM identity — contact name, title, external organization, and the CRM/case-management record identifiers. This is the final hop from "a conversation happened" to "who it was about"; not every BYOI conversation links a resolved contact, so treat this as a left join |

The `externalcontacts.get.contact` step fans out per participant carrying a non-null `externalContactId`
(usually the customer-purpose participant). It closes the loop the BYOI guide describes: the provider
injects the call with an `externalContactId` reference, and this endpoint is how Genesys.Core resolves
that reference back into a display-ready identity without a second CRM API call. Track its resolution
rate as an executive metric — a BYOI channel with a low `externalContactId` resolution rate indicates the
provider integration isn't populating identity linkage correctly.

### BYOI Conversation in Analytics

BYOI conversations flow through the same Architect flows, queue routing, and analytics pipeline
as native Genesys conversations. The following datasets apply identically:
- `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` — segment timing is accurate
- `conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata` — recordings exist if enabled
- `quality.get.evaluations.query` — evaluations proceed normally
- `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` — reflects the BYOI SIP-to-SIP handoff, not a PSTN leg

### Embeddable Framework Conversations

Conversations visible to agents via the Embeddable Framework return the same object shape as
`conversations.get.conversation.object`. The condensed view used by the embedded client includes:
`participants[].purpose`, `participants[].state`, `participants[].calls[].state`,
`participants[].calls[].muted`, `participants[].calls[].held`. These fields are present in the
full object returned by the dataset and need no special handling.

---

## 7. Agent Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Agent Investigation (`Get-GenesysAgentInvestigation`) covers 8 steps. These additional
datasets enrich the investigation without replacing any existing step.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| utilization | `routing.get.user.utilization` | `userId` | Max channel capacities — why can the agent only handle N simultaneous chats? |
| currentStatus | `users.get.agent.current.routing.status` | `userId` | Routing state at investigation time (IDLE / INTERACTING / OFF_QUEUE) |
| activeConversations | `users.get.agent.active.conversations` | `userId` | In-progress conversations if `currentStatus = INTERACTING` |
| qualityActivity | `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | Evaluation count, average/highest/lowest scores for the window |
| coaching | `coaching.get.appointments` | `userId` | Coaching sessions attending/facilitating in the window |

**Trigger conditions:** `currentStatus` and `activeConversations` steps are conditional on the
agent being in an active state at investigation time. `coaching` step is conditional on WFM being
licensed and configured.

---

## 8. Conversation Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Conversation Investigation (`Get-GenesysConversationInvestigation`) covers 8 steps.
These additional datasets complete the deep-dive picture.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| analyticsDetail | `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` | `conversationId` | Per-segment timing (IVR, ACD wait, talk, hold, ACW) — replaces the query-based analytics step |
| sipTrace | `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | SIP signaling trace (voice only, conditional) |
| sentimentTimeline | `speech.and.text.analytics.get.sentiment.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | Per-utterance sentiment (STA enabled only, conditional) |
| customAttributes | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | `conversationId` | IVR/Architect custom attribute payload |
| participantAttributes | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | `conversationId` | Participant-level flow variables |
| transcriptUrl | `speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl` | `communicationId` | Transcript download URL (transcription enabled only) |

**Conditional steps:** `sipTrace` runs only when `conversations.get.conversation.object.participants[].calls` is
non-empty (voice conversation). `sentimentTimeline` runs only when `conversations.get.speech.text.analytics`
returns `speechAndTextAnalyticsConversation.analysisStatus = "Success"`.

---

## 9. Queue Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Queue Investigation (`Get-GenesysQueueInvestigation`) covers 6 steps. These additions
complete the picture.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| queueConfig | `routing.get.single.queue.config` | `queueId` | Full queue config (replaces/enriches the routing-queues list step) |
| wrapupLabels | `routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue` | `queueId` | Human-readable labels for the wrapup distribution step |
| transfers | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId` | Transfer rate and type breakdown |
| wrapupDistribution | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId` | Wrapup code frequencies (join wrapupLabels for labels) |
| conversationDetail | `analytics-conversation-details-query` (queueId filter) | `conversationId` | Individual conversations for case-level review |

---

## 10. Self-Service Deflection Enrichment (Bot Flow + Knowledge)

**Subject:** Architect flow/bot flow rollup, or a single flow incident  
**Use case:** The existing `flow-and-ivr-performance` executive playbook and `flow-and-ivr-diagnostics`
voice engineer playbook measured Architect-flow-level containment (`nFlow`, `nFlowOutcome`,
`nFlowOutcomeFailed`) but had no visibility into *why* a bot flow failed to contain a caller, and no
measure of self-service that happens entirely outside a flow — a knowledge article answering a chat or
search before a conversation ever starts. Two dataset families close that gap:

| Dataset Key | Endpoint | What It Adds |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| `analytics.get.botflow.turn.reporting` | `GET /api/v2/analytics/botflows/{botFlowId}/reportingturns` | Turn-by-turn bot flow detail — recognized intent, confidence, and outcome per conversational turn. Diagnoses recognition failures at the specific prompt/utterance, not just the flow as a whole |
| `analytics.get.botflow.sessions` | `GET /api/v2/analytics/botflows/{botFlowId}/sessions` | Session list for a bot flow, in reverse-chronological order — used to enumerate affected sessions before pulling turn detail. **The API retains these ~10 days**, so pull promptly after an incident |
| `analytics.query.knowledge.aggregates` | `POST /api/v2/analytics/knowledge/aggregates/query` | Knowledge base search/view/answer-feedback counts by knowledge base and document — quantifies deflection that happens without ever opening a conversation |

### Key Joins

```
flows.get.all.flows[].id (where flowType = 'bot')
  → analytics.get.botflow.sessions.botFlowId
  → analytics.get.botflow.turn.reporting.botFlowId (turn-level detail for sessions of interest)

analytics.query.knowledge.aggregates.results[].group.knowledgeBaseId
  → knowledge.get.knowledgebase (label resolution, not currently a catalog dataset — raw endpoint
    getKnowledgeKnowledgebase)
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- Which specific turn in a bot flow has low recognition confidence, and is it degrading over time?
- Executive rollup: what fraction of self-service is architect-flow containment vs. knowledge-article
  deflection — i.e., calls that never left the IVR vs. contacts that never started at all?
- Voice engineer incident response: after a bot flow containment drop, which sessions were affected and
  what did the failing turns actually say?
- Is a rising knowledge-base search volume with a falling answer rate on a topic quietly feeding
  avoidable escalations into a queue?

### Why This Stays Additive, Not a Data Dump

Both additions are deliberately narrow: one turn-level endpoint (not the full bot conversation transcript)
and one knowledge aggregate query (not per-article raw feedback records). They answer "where is
self-service breaking down" without requiring a reviewer to read raw bot transcripts or article-by-article
feedback logs — consistent with the catalog's goal of informative-not-overwhelming output.
