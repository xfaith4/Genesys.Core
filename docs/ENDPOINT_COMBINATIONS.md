> Companion to: [INVESTIGATIONS.md](INVESTIGATIONS.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

This document describes how catalog datasets combine into coherent investigations and executive
reporting rollups. Each combination is documented with its subject, the ordered dataset steps,
the join keys that connect them, and the analytical questions it answers.

The goal of Genesys.Core is to be **informative without being a data dump**. Every combination
here answers a specific operational question and terminates when that question is answered — not
when the API is exhausted.

## 1. Single Conversation Deep Dive (Voice Engineer)

**Subject:** One `conversationId`  
**Use case:** A voice engineer or QM analyst receives a complaint about a specific call — wrong queue, long hold, audio quality, dropped call, incorrect routing. They need the complete picture of one conversation: where it came from, how it routed, how long each phase took, what the SIP signaling said, whether a recording exists, and what the quality score was.

**Core question:** *What actually happened in this conversation, end-to-end?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `conversations.get.conversation.object` | seed → `conversationId` | Participants, sessions, DNIS/ANI, start/end times, queue assignment, externalTag (BYOI indicator) |
| 2 | `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` | `conversationId` | Per-segment timing: IVR duration, ACD wait, talk time, hold time, ACW, conference, recording start/stop |
| 3 | `conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata` | `conversationId` | Recording IDs, media type, duration, deletion schedule |
| 4 | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | `conversationId` | Custom attributes set by IVR/Architect flows (account numbers, intent, escalation flags) |
| 5 | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | `conversationId` | Participant-level attributes (IVR variables, data action outcomes, flow-set values) |
| 6 | `quality.get.evaluations.query` | `conversationId` | QM evaluation scores, form used, evaluator, calibration status |
| 7 | `quality.get.surveys` | `conversationId` | Post-call CSAT/NPS survey result if survey was triggered |
| 8 *(voice only)* | `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | SIP signaling trace: INVITE, 200 OK, BYE, re-INVITE, codec negotiation |
| 9 *(STA enabled)* | `conversations.get.speech.text.analytics` | `conversationId` | Sentiment score, detected topics, STA coverage summary |
| 10 *(STA enabled)* | `speech.and.text.analytics.get.sentiment.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | Sentiment timeline: per-utterance scores, agent vs customer breakdown |
| 11 *(transcription enabled)* | `speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl` | `conversationId` + `communicationId` | Transcript download URL per communication leg |

### Key Joins

```
conversations.get.conversation.object.conversationId
  → analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics.conversationId (segment overlay)
  → conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata.conversationId
  → telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation.conversationId (voice only)
  → quality.get.evaluations.query[].conversationId (left join — evaluations may not exist)

analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics.participants[].sessions[].communicationId
  → speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl.communicationId
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- What was the full call flow? (IVR → ACD → agent → hold → ACW)
- How long did the customer wait before an agent answered?
- Was the call transferred? How many times? What queue received the transfer?
- Was a recording made? Does it still exist?
- Did the SIP trunk establish media correctly? (from SIP trace)
- Was the agent rated? What was the QM score?
- Was the customer surveyed? What was the CSAT result?
- What intent/attributes did the IVR capture before routing?

### Voice Engineer Notes

Step 8 (SIP trace) is the definitive source for:
- Call setup failures (no 200 OK, 486 Busy, 503 Service Unavailable)
- One-way audio (media IP mismatch in SDP)
- Premature disconnection (BYE before expected, no 200 OK to BYE)
- Codec negotiation failures

The `telephony.get.edge.performance.metrics` dataset (`GET /api/v2/telephony/providers/edges/{edgeId}/metrics`)
should be pulled for the Edge appliance that handled the call if CPU, memory, or error counters suggest
resource pressure during the conversation window.

### BYOI Indicator

If `conversations.get.conversation.object` returns a non-null `externalTag` or `externalConversationId`,
the call was injected via the BYOI integration (`POST /api/v2/conversations/providers/{providerId}/calls`).
Custom attributes in step 4 will contain the provider's context (CRM case ID, external call ID).
The SIP trace (step 8) will reflect the provider's SIP-to-SIP handoff, not an inbound PSTN leg.

## 2. All Conversations in a Queue

**Subject:** One `queueId` + time window  
**Use case:** A contact centre supervisor or operations analyst needs to understand the health and
behaviour of a specific queue over a period — volume patterns, handle times, abandons, transfer
rates, and wrapup outcomes.

**Core question:** *How did this queue perform, and what were the conversations like?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `routing.get.single.queue.config` | seed → `queueId` | Queue name, routing method, SLA targets, media types, skill evaluation mode |
| 2 | `routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue` | `queueId` | Human-readable wrapup code labels for the queue |
| 3 | `analytics-conversation-details-query` (queueId filter) | `queueId` | Every conversation that touched this queue in the window, with participant/segment detail |
| 4 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance` | `queueId` | Aggregate: nConnected, tHandle, tTalk, tAcw, tAnswered, tHeld, nOffered, nOutbound |
| 5 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` | `queueId` | Abandon count: nAbandoned, tAbandon, tShortAbandon |
| 6 | `analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level` | `queueId` | SLA achievement: nAnsweredIn20/30/60, oServiceLevel, oServiceTarget, nOverSla |
| 7 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId` | Transfer analysis: nTransferred, nBlindTransferred, nConsultTransferred |
| 8 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId` + wrapUpCode | Wrapup code frequencies (join step 2 for labels) |
| 9 | `routing-queue-members` | `queueId` | Current membership roster with routing status and presence |
| 10 | `quality.get.evaluations.query` (queueId filter) | `conversationId` | QM evaluation coverage and scores for conversations in this queue |

### Key Joins

```
routing.get.single.queue.config.id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.*.queueId (aggregate overlay)
  → routing-queue-members.queueId (who was staffed)

analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution.wrapUpCode
  → routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue.id (label resolution)

analytics-conversation-details-query[].conversationId
  → quality.get.evaluations.query[].conversationId (left join — not all conversations are evaluated)
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- What was the offered/connected/abandoned volume for this queue?
- Did the queue meet its SLA target? In which hourly intervals did it miss?
- What percentage of conversations were transferred? Where did they go?
- What wrapup codes dominated, and what do they mean?
- Who were the active agents? What was their routing status during the window?
- How many conversations were quality-reviewed? What was the average score?

### Divisions as Queue Groups

Queues within a division represent a natural management boundary — a division is effectively
a group of queues and agents. To investigate an entire division:
1. Use `authorization.list.division.queues` to get all queue IDs in the division.
2. Fan out the steps above once per queue, or use `authorization.get.single.division` as the
   seed and filter analytics queries with `divisionId` predicates.

---

## 3. Division / Agent Group Investigation

**Subject:** One `divisionId` + time window  
**Use case:** A contact centre director or workforce analyst needs to understand how a specific
business unit (division) performed — which agents are in it, what volume each handled, time-in-state,
quality scores, and coaching coverage.

**Core question:** *How did this division's agents perform as a group?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `authorization.get.single.division` | seed → `divisionId` | Division name, description, home-division flag |
| 2 | `authorization.list.division.queues` | `divisionId` | All queue IDs assigned to this division |
| 3 | `users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info` | `divisionId` | All agents assigned to the division with user IDs |
| 4 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance` (divisionId filter) | `userId` | Per-agent: nConnected, tHandle, tTalk, tAcw, tAnswered |
| 5 | `analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity` (divisionId filter) | `userId` | Per-agent time-in-state: tAgentRoutingStatus, tSystemPresence, tOrganizationPresence |
| 6 | `analytics.query.user.details.activity.report` (userId list) | `userId` | Login/logout/on-queue presence event timeline per agent |
| 7 | `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | QM evaluation counts, highest/average/lowest scores per agent |
| 8 | `coaching.get.appointments` | `userId` | Coaching sessions scheduled/completed for agents in the window |
| 9 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` (divisionId filter) | `queueId` | Wrapup code distribution across all queues in the division |

### Key Joins

```
authorization.get.single.division.id
  → authorization.list.division.queues.divisionId (queue enumeration)
  → users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info.divisionId (agent enumeration)

users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info[].id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance[].userId
  → analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity[].userId
  → quality.get.agents.activity[].user.id
  → coaching.get.appointments[].attendees[].id
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- How many agents are in this division and who are they?
- What queues does this division own?
- Which agents handled the most volume? Which had the highest AHT?
- Which agents spent the most time off-queue or in non-productive states?
- Which agents have been evaluated? Who has the highest/lowest scores?
- Which agents have received recent coaching? Is coaching correlated with score improvement?

### Division vs Queue as Investigation Entry Point

| Start with | When you know | You get |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `queueId` | Specific queue complaints | All conversations + SLA + wrapup + member roster |
| `divisionId` | Business unit or team scope | All queues + all agents + group performance |
| `userId` (Agent Investigation) | Specific agent complaint | That agent's conversations + skills + presence |

---

## 4. Executive Reporting Rollup

**Subject:** Organisation-wide (or multi-queue) + reporting window (weekly/monthly)  
**Use case:** A VP or Director of Operations needs a concise performance summary suitable for
executive review — not a data dump, but the headline KPIs grouped logically.

**Core question:** *How did the contact centre perform this period, by which dimensions?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered by reporting layer)

#### Layer 1 — Volume & Efficiency
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance` | `queueId`, `mediaType`, daily granularity | nOffered, nConnected, tHandle (avg), tTalk (avg), tAcw (avg) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` | `queueId`, `mediaType`, daily | nAbandoned, tAbandon, nOffered (abandon rate = nAbandoned/nOffered) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.digital.channels` | `mediaType`, `queueId`, daily | Channel mix: nOffered, nConnected by voice/chat/email/message |

#### Layer 2 — Service Quality
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level` | `queueId`, daily | oServiceLevel, nOverSla, nAnsweredIn20 (configurable speed-of-answer) |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId`, daily | Transfer rate: nTransferred / nConnected |
| `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId`, `wrapUpCode`, daily | Wrapup mix — outcome analysis |

#### Layer 3 — Workforce
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `analytics.query.user.aggregates.login.activity` | `userId`, daily | tAgentRoutingStatus: available, busy, on-queue time per agent |
| `analytics.query.user.aggregates.performance.metrics` | `userId`, daily | nConnected, tHandle (avg) per agent — productivity comparison |

#### Layer 4 — Quality & Voice-of-Customer
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | Evaluation coverage rate, average score, score distribution |
| `quality.get.surveys` | `conversationId` (aggregate) | CSAT/NPS: response rate, average score |
| `analytics.post.transcripts.aggregates.query` | `queueId`, `userId`, daily | Speech analytics coverage: nSpeechTextAnalyzedConversations, oSentimentScore |

#### Layer 5 — Infrastructure Health (optional, voice-focused)
| Dataset Key | Grouping | Metrics |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `telephony.get.trunk.metrics.summary` | — | SIP trunk utilisation, errors |
| `telephony.get.edges` | `edgeId` | Edge registration status |
| `alerting.get.alerts` | — | Currently firing threshold alerts |

### Executive Dashboard Composition Pattern

```
Period: Last 28 days, daily granularity
Queues: All production queues (from routing-queues, filtered by active=true)

Headline metrics (computed, not raw):
  - Total handled: SUM(nConnected) across all queues
  - Abandon rate: SUM(nAbandoned) / SUM(nOffered) × 100
  - Average handle time: WAVG(tHandle, nConnected)
  - SLA achievement: queues meeting target / total queues × 100
  - Transfer rate: SUM(nTransferred) / SUM(nConnected) × 100
  - QM coverage: evaluations / nConnected × 100
  - Average QM score: from quality.get.agents.activity
  - Avg CSAT: from quality.get.surveys

Trend views (daily granularity):
  - Volume by day with channel mix
  - AHT trend by queue
  - Abandon rate trend by queue
  - SLA achievement heatmap by queue × day
```

### Key Joins for Executive Reporting

```
routing-queues[].id
  → analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.*.results[].group.queueId
  → routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue.queueId (label resolution)
  → quality.get.agents.activity (left join via queue membership)

analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution[].group.wrapUpCode
  → routing.get.all.wrapup.codes[].id (global wrapup code labels)
```

## 5. Real-Time Operations Monitoring

**Subject:** Organisation or specific queues (no fixed window — point-in-time)  
**Use case:** A real-time analyst, supervisor, or NOC team needs a live view of queue health and
agent availability right now, without waiting for a historical analytics job.

**Core question:** *What is happening in the contact centre this moment?*

### Dataset Steps (real-time, polling pattern)

| Step | Dataset Key | Scope | What It Shows |
|------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | `analytics.query.queue.observations.real.time.stats` | All queues | oInteracting, oWaiting, oOnQueueUsers, oOffQueueUsers, oActiveUsers per queue |
| 2 | `analytics.query.conversation.activity.real.time` | All queues | oInteracting, oWaiting, oAlerting, oLongestWaiting per queue × mediaType |
| 3 | `analytics.query.user.observations.real.time.status` | All agents | oUserPresence (system presence), oUserRoutingStatus per agent |
| 4 | `analytics.get.agent.active.status` | One agent | Full real-time channel assignment for a specific agent — active conversation IDs |
| 5 | `users.get.agent.active.conversations` | One agent | All in-progress conversations for a specific agent |
| 6 | `users.get.agent.current.routing.status` | One agent | Current routing state (IDLE / INTERACTING / NOT_RESPONDING / OFF_QUEUE) |
| 7 | `analytics.query.flow.observations` | All flows | oFlow: active Architect flows currently executing |
| 8 *(telephony NOC)* | `telephony.get.trunk.metrics.summary` | — | Trunk utilisation and error counters |
| 9 *(telephony NOC)* | `telephony.get.edge.performance.metrics` | One Edge | CPU, memory, active call count on specific Edge |

### Polling Note

Real-time datasets (`analytics.query.queue.observations.real.time.stats`,
`analytics.query.conversation.activity.real.time`, `analytics.query.user.observations.real.time.status`)
do not accept `interval` parameters — they reflect the current state as of the API call. These
should be polled at the rate appropriate for the display (typically 10–30 seconds for a wall board).

The `analytics.get.agent.active.status` endpoint returns a single agent's live state and is
intended for targeted drilldown (supervisor clicks on an agent in the wall board).

---

## 6. BYOI External Conversation Enrichment

**Subject:** One `conversationId` that was injected via BYOI  
**Use case:** A conversation originated in an external system (CRM telephony, third-party contact
centre, a custom SIP provider) and was injected into Genesys Cloud via the BYOI provider API
(`POST /api/v2/conversations/providers/{providerId}/calls`). The conversation appears in Genesys
analytics and recordings, but context lives in the external system.

**Core question:** *Where did this conversation come from, and what external context does it carry?*

### How to Identify a BYOI Conversation

In step 1 of the Conversation Investigation, `conversations.get.conversation.object` returns:

```json
{
  "externalTag": "<your-provider-set-tag>",
  "externalConversationId": "<provider-conversation-id>",
  "participants": [
    { "purpose": "external", "externalContactId": "..." }
  ]
}
```

A non-null `externalTag` is the definitive BYOI indicator.

### Additional Steps for BYOI Conversations

| Step | Dataset Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| + | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | Provider-set custom attributes: CRM case ID, intent label, external call ID |
| + | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | IVR/Architect variables set during the injected conversation flow |

### BYOI Conversation in Analytics

BYOI conversations flow through the same Architect flows, queue routing, and analytics pipeline
as native Genesys conversations. The following datasets apply identically:
- `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` — segment timing is accurate
- `conversations.get.conversation.recording.metadata` — recordings exist if enabled
- `quality.get.evaluations.query` — evaluations proceed normally
- `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` — reflects the BYOI SIP-to-SIP handoff, not a PSTN leg

### Embeddable Framework Conversations

Conversations visible to agents via the Embeddable Framework return the same object shape as
`conversations.get.conversation.object`. The condensed view used by the embedded client includes:
`participants[].purpose`, `participants[].state`, `participants[].calls[].state`,
`participants[].calls[].muted`, `participants[].calls[].held`. These fields are present in the
full object returned by the dataset and need no special handling.

---

## 7. Agent Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Agent Investigation (`Get-GenesysAgentInvestigation`) covers 8 steps. These additional
datasets enrich the investigation without replacing any existing step.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| utilization | `routing.get.user.utilization` | `userId` | Max channel capacities — why can the agent only handle N simultaneous chats? |
| currentStatus | `users.get.agent.current.routing.status` | `userId` | Routing state at investigation time (IDLE / INTERACTING / OFF_QUEUE) |
| activeConversations | `users.get.agent.active.conversations` | `userId` | In-progress conversations if `currentStatus = INTERACTING` |
| qualityActivity | `quality.get.agents.activity` | `userId` | Evaluation count, average/highest/lowest scores for the window |
| coaching | `coaching.get.appointments` | `userId` | Coaching sessions attending/facilitating in the window |

**Trigger conditions:** `currentStatus` and `activeConversations` steps are conditional on the
agent being in an active state at investigation time. `coaching` step is conditional on WFM being
licensed and configured.

---

## 8. Conversation Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Conversation Investigation (`Get-GenesysConversationInvestigation`) covers 8 steps.
These additional datasets complete the deep-dive picture.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| analyticsDetail | `analytics.get.single.conversation.analytics` | `conversationId` | Per-segment timing (IVR, ACD wait, talk, hold, ACW) — replaces the query-based analytics step |
| sipTrace | `telephony.get.sip.messages.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | SIP signaling trace (voice only, conditional) |
| sentimentTimeline | `speech.and.text.analytics.get.sentiment.for.conversation` | `conversationId` | Per-utterance sentiment (STA enabled only, conditional) |
| customAttributes | `conversations.get.conversation.customattributes` | `conversationId` | IVR/Architect custom attribute payload |
| participantAttributes | `conversations.search.participant.attributes` | `conversationId` | Participant-level flow variables |
| transcriptUrl | `speechandtextanalytics.get.conversation.communication.transcripturl` | `communicationId` | Transcript download URL (transcription enabled only) |

**Conditional steps:** `sipTrace` runs only when `conversations.get.conversation.object.participants[].calls` is
non-empty (voice conversation). `sentimentTimeline` runs only when `conversations.get.speech.text.analytics`
returns `speechAndTextAnalyticsConversation.analysisStatus = "Success"`.

---

## 9. Queue Investigation Extensions (Release 1.3)

The existing Queue Investigation (`Get-GenesysQueueInvestigation`) covers 6 steps. These additions
complete the picture.

| Extension Step | Dataset Key | JoinOn | What It Adds |
|----------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| queueConfig | `routing.get.single.queue.config` | `queueId` | Full queue config (replaces/enriches the routing-queues list step) |
| wrapupLabels | `routing.get.queue.wrapup.codes.by.queue` | `queueId` | Human-readable labels for the wrapup distribution step |
| transfers | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.transfer.metrics` | `queueId` | Transfer rate and type breakdown |
| wrapupDistribution | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.wrapup.distribution` | `queueId` | Wrapup code frequencies (join wrapupLabels for labels) |
| conversationDetail | `analytics-conversation-details-query` (queueId filter) | `conversationId` | Individual conversations for case-level review |

---

## 11. Division-Scoped Executive Rollup (Cross-Queue Agent Groups)

**Subject:** One `divisionId` (or a small set of divisions) + reporting window
**Use case:** A division is not a queue and not a single team — it is a permissions/ownership
boundary that can span many queues and many agents who may also sit in other divisions' queues.
Executives think in divisions ("How is the EMEA Support division doing?"), not in raw queue IDs.
This combination composes the [Division Investigation](#3-division--agent-group-investigation)
enumeration step with the [Executive Reporting Rollup](#4-executive-reporting-rollup) aggregate
layer so a division becomes a first-class rollup dimension instead of something an analyst has
to reconstruct by hand from a queue list.

**Core question:** *How is this division performing, rolled up across every queue it owns —
and is that different from how its member agents perform when they work outside the division?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `authorization.get.single.division` | seed → `divisionId` | Division identity, home-division flag |
| 2 | `authorization.list.division.queues` | `divisionId` | Every queue the division owns — the rollup fan-out set |
| 3 | `users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info` | `divisionId` | Every agent whose home division is this one |
| 4 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance` (queueId **IN** step-2 set) | `queueId` | Volume/handle-time rolled up per queue, then summed for the division |
| 5 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` (queueId **IN** step-2 set) | `queueId` | Division-wide abandon rate = Σ nAbandoned / Σ nOffered across owned queues |

| 7 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance` (userId **IN** step-3 set) | `userId` | Per-agent productivity for every agent whose home is this division — **including volume they handled in queues owned by other divisions**, which is the cross-queue signal a pure queue rollup would miss |
| 8 | `quality.get.agents.activity` (userId **IN** step-3 set) | `userId` | Division-wide QM coverage and average score |

### Key Joins

```
authorization.get.single.division.id
  → authorization.list.division.queues.divisionId (queue fan-out set, "owned queues")
  → users.division.analysis.get.users.with.division.info.divisionId (agent fan-out set, "home agents")

For each queueId in the owned-queue set:
  analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.queue.performance[].group.queueId
  analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics[].group.queueId
  analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level[].group.queueId
    → SUM/WAVG into one division-level row (computed client-side, not an API aggregate)

For each userId in the home-agent set:
  analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.agent.performance[].group.userId
    → may reference queueId values OUTSIDE the owned-queue set — this is expected and is the
      point of joining on userId rather than filtering by queueId alone
```

### Why Queue-Only and Division-Only Rollups Both Under-Report

- Filtering by **owned queues alone** (steps 4–6) misses volume that a division's agents handle
  while covering a queue that belongs to a *different* division — common when divisions share a
  cross-skilled overflow pool.
- Filtering by **agent home-division alone** (step 7) misses queue-level SLA/abandon context,
  because those metrics are computed per-queue, not per-agent.
- The combination above computes **two rollups side by side** (owned-queue performance and
  home-agent performance) and reports both. A meaningful gap between them — e.g. home agents show
  higher volume than owned queues report — is itself a finding worth surfacing to the executive
  reader: it usually means the division is absorbing overflow work its own SLA metrics don't
  reflect.

### Executive Presentation Pattern

```
Division: EMEA Support
Owned queues: 6        Home agents: 42

Owned-queue rollup (this division's own SLA exposure):
  nOffered: 18,420   nConnected: 17,003   Abandon rate: 3.1%   SLA achievement: 92% (5.5/6 queues)

Home-agent rollup (what this division's people actually handled, any queue):
  nConnected: 19,880   →  2,877 more than owned-queue nConnected
  Interpretation: agents are net exporters of ~15% capacity to other divisions' queues.
```

This two-number pattern (owned vs. home) is deliberately small — two headline rollups, not a
queue-by-queue or agent-by-agent dump — consistent with the "informative, not a data dump" goal.
Drill-down to the underlying queue or agent rows belongs in the [Division Investigation](#3-division--agent-group-investigation)
or [Agent Investigation](#7-agent-investigation-extensions-release-13), not in the executive view.

## 12. Audit-Trail Root-Cause Correlation

**Subject:** One `queueId` or `divisionId` + an anomaly window (e.g. the hour an SLA miss or
abandon spike was observed)
**Use case:** A voice engineer or operations analyst sees a metric move — SLA drops, abandon rate
spikes, a queue stops routing calls — and needs to know **whether a configuration change caused
it**, not just that it happened. `audit-logs` records every config mutation (queue edit, skill
requirement change, membership change, routing rule change) with an actor and timestamp; overlaying
it on the performance timeline turns "SLA dropped at 14:00" into "SLA dropped at 14:00, three
minutes after `jane@x.com` removed the overflow routing rule from this queue at 13:57."

**Core question:** *Did a configuration change cause this performance anomaly, and who made it?*

### Dataset Steps (ordered)

| Step | Dataset Key | Join Key | What It Adds |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `routing.get.single.queue.config` | seed → `queueId` | Current queue configuration as a baseline |
| 2 | `analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level` (queue/window body filter, hourly granularity) | `queueId` | SLA timeline — pinpoints the interval(s) where the metric moved |
| 3 | `analytics.query.conversation.aggregates.abandon.metrics` (queue/window body filter, hourly) | `queueId` | Abandon timeline — cross-check against SLA to rule out volume spikes vs. config causes |
| 4 | `audit-logs` (`EntityType=Queue`, `EntityId=queueId`, window = anomaly window ± 30 min) | `queueId` | Every config mutation to this queue in the surrounding window, with `actor`, `changeType`, `oldValue`/`newValue` |
| 5 *(if step 4 shows a membership or skill change)* | `authorization.list.division.queues` or `users.get.user.routing.skills` | `queueId` / `userId` | Confirms whether the change is still in effect or was reverted |
| 6 *(if the anomaly tracks to a specific division)* | `audit-logs` (`EntityType=Division`, `EntityId=divisionId`) | `divisionId` | Division-level permission or ownership changes (queue reassignment between divisions) |

### Key Joins

```
routing.get.single.queue.config.id
  → analytics.query.queue.aggregates.service.level[].group.queueId (anomaly timeline)
  → audit-logs[].entityId (EntityType=Queue) (candidate cause events, same queueId)

Correlate by time, not by a shared foreign key:
  audit-logs[].timestamp within [anomaly_start - 30min, anomaly_end]
    AND audit-logs[].entityId == queueId
  → ranked candidate causes, most recent change first
```

### Analytical Questions Answered

- Was this queue's configuration changed in the window before the anomaly?
- Who made the change, and was it authorized (compare against a change-ticket reference if the
  audit entry carries one)?
- Did a skill requirement or membership change reduce the effective agent pool for this queue?
- Is the anomaly still active, or did a subsequent audit entry revert the change?

### Scope Discipline

This combination is intentionally **triggered by an anomaly**, not run continuously — `audit-logs`
is a wide, low-signal dataset on its own. Pulling it only for a bounded `EntityId` + narrow time
window (step 4) keeps the investigation targeted; pulling all audit logs for a division or org
without a specific `queueId`/`userId`/time anchor turns this into exactly the kind of data dump
the catalog's design goal warns against.
